WOULD BE NICE

    Move address queries like IsLoopback, IsGlobalUnicast etc to flags and precalculate on address creation

    Split address out of yojmibo_network.h so addresses can be used without including sockets

    Implement windows platform_time and convert client and server across to absolute time updating (eg. detect dropped frames etc.)
