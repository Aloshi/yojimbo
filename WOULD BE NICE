WOULD BE NICE

    ------------------

    Would be nice to check the size, file and line # in the free entry matches the pointer passed in.

    ------------------

    There is a lot of code duplication between the default allocator and TLSF allocator for #if YOJIMBO_DEBUG_MEMORY_LEAKS

    It would be nice if this code was not duplicated. For example, it could be made part of the base allocator

    ------------------

    It would be nice if the allocators could check for memory leaks between each test run, that way, I'd know at the end of each unit test if memory was leaked, rather than needing to binary search tests to find out which test leaked memory.

    ------------------

    Add a test for clients to connect, without messages enabled, and then send no packets for timeout * 2 seconds. 

    This verifies that the keep-alive packets work.

    ------------------

    There is no test currently that checks that a client can connect, disconnect, and reconnect and send messages successfully post-reconnection.

    This is necessary to ensure that the connection state is properly cleaned up after a client disconnect.

    Add this test!

    ------------------

    Important to add tests that simulate each of the server-side client error conditions, eg. allocator, packet factory, message factory, connection, and then verify that after these errors happen, that client slot is cleared and a client can connect to it again, otherwise, possibility that I have error codes not getting cleared by accident on client disconnect.

    ------------------

    Implement QoS within the connection, eg. packet loss, latency measurements etc, and make this available to the user to query.

    ------------------

    Add functionality to connection and client/server to get the set of packet acks, so users can get acks and build their own systems on top of that.

    ------------------

    Optimize the simulator to keep track of head and tail internally, so it can avoid scanning the entire 4096 entries on each receive call.

    ------------------

    Definitely need more usage documentation and samples showing how to do stuff.

    I don't know that it's immediately obvious how to use libyojimbo from the samples. Or, what exactly libyojimbo does or what it's for?

    Also, better documentation could be added explaining what yojimbo is for (dedicated servers), and how its protocol works.

    Perhaps a bunch of posts to gafferongames.com would be a good idea to start?

    ------------------

    Really need to make the matcher HTTPS request asynchronous, can't have it blocking the main thread like it does now!

    ------------------

    Need to get coverity setup to run with a travis job. Right now, it needs to be run manually, by somebody.

    It should be setup to run automatically on each commit to "coverity" branch, then I can create a premake action to determine current branch, mainline or development, and integrate across current head to that branch.

    eg. pm coverity

    ------------------

    The connection and channels code seems a bit rough. Should consider a second pass, to see if I can make it simpler. It's the code is hard to understand. Even for me, and I wrote it =p

    ------------------

    Clean up profile.cpp with helper methods. It's overly complicated for what it does!

    ------------------
