WOULD BE NICE

    ------------------

    Implement QoS within the connection, eg. packet loss, latency measurements etc, and make this available to the user to query.

    ------------------

    Add functionality to connection and client/server to get the set of packet acks, so users can get acks and build their own systems on top of that.

    ------------------

    Optimize the simulator to use a sliding window internally, so it can keep track of head and tail, and avoid scanning the entire 4096 entries on each receive.

    ------------------

    Definitely need more usage documentation and samples showing how to do stuff.

    I don't know that it's immediately obvious how to use libyojimbo from the samples. Or, what exactly libyojimbo does or what it's for?

    Also, better documentation could be added explaining what yojimbo is for (dedicated servers), and how its protocol works.

    Perhaps a bunch of posts to gafferongames.com would be a good idea to start?

    ------------------

    Really need to make the matcher HTTPS request asynchronous, can't have it blocking the main thread like it does now!

    ------------------

    Need to get coverity setup to run with a travis job. Right now, it needs to be run manually, by somebody.

    It should be setup to run automatically on each commit to "coverity" branch, then I can create a premake action to determine current branch, mainline or development, and integrate across current head to that branch.

    eg. pm coverity

    ------------------

    The connection and channels code seems a bit rough. Should consider a second pass, to see if I can make it simpler. It's the code is hard to understand. Even for me, and I wrote it =p

    ------------------

    Clean up profile.cpp with helper methods. It's overly complicated for what it does!

    ------------------
