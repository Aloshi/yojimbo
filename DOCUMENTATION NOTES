DOCUMENTATION NOTES

    -------------------------------

    DefaultEncryptionMappingTimeOut is problematic. It's set to 5 seconds in yojimbo_config.h, which means if anybody dynamically sets up a longer timeout, the encryption mapping constant would effectively override it for secure packets. This is bad.

    -------------------------------

    The key concern is basically this:

    yojimbo is currently single threaded.

    What does a multithreaded yojimbo look like?

    What has to change?

    -------------------------------

    What about thread safety for queuing messages. Should I redesign the API around atomic queues?

    What about the allocator, does it need to be made multithreaded?

    What about message factory?

    -------------------------------

    There is no easy way to broadcast an event to multiple clients from the server.

    Would repeatedly sending the same event to clients work with ref counting? I think it *could8, but right now, I don't think the send message adds a ref, so it won't.

    -------------------------------

    Channel callback to connection, which then calls back to Client/Server is lame.

    Maybe queue up an array of events instead, and provide the caller with a way to process events once per-frame instead?

    I also dislike it, because it could eventually be a callback coming in from a connection running on its own thread = bad.
