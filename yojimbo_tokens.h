        Connect token passed from the client to server when it requests a secure connection.

        How do connect tokens work?

        First, matcher.go generates a connect token equivalent structure in golang, encodes it to JSON, encrypts it, base64 encodes it and transmits it to the client over HTTPS.

        The client receives this encrypted connect token over HTTPS when it requests a match, along with information about which servers to connect to, and the keys for packet encryption (hence the need for HTTPS).

        The client takes the connect token and passes it to each server it tries to connect to inside connection request packets. The server inspects these connection request packets and only allows connections from clients with a valid connect token.

        This creates a system where servers only allow connections from authenticated clients, effectively transmitting whatever authentication the backend has performed to the dedicated servers, without the dedicated servers and matcher needing to have any direct communication.
