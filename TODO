    Integrate packet loss, latency from reliable.io

    Client and server need some way to get statistics to return to client, eg. num packets sent, num packets received, packet loss %, rtt milliseconds.

    Test these between a real client and server running on my linode, eg. print out network stats on client every few seconds.

    Having some trouble testing connection to linode server. Firewall issues?

    Resolved. Was rejecting packets incoming to lo0, not originating from localhost. Binding to server IP fixed it.

    Simplified RTT calculation and added more smoothing.

TODO

    ------------

    Add ability to back-channel connect client and server (at the base client level).

    This should allow the ability to pump in client -> server packets for a connected slot, and server -> client packets.

    This will enable local loopback packet exchange between a client and server, and should work to a standard interface that is the same across all client/server implementations.

    This should be implemented as a netcode.io feature, and ideally integrated such that portions are in base client/server and can be reused easily across client/server impls.

    ------------

    Pass over doxygen documentation again.
