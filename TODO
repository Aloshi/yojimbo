DONE

    Inherit custom GameClient and GameServer classes from base client and server.

    Did the same for GameNetworkInterface and GamePacketFactory.

    There seems to be some sort of weirdness with the disconnect packet set from client -> server?

    Ah. There was a packet leak if the packet failed to decrypt (eg. broken encryption mapping)

TODO

    Setup in server a virtual for each log that already exists.

    Move the logs into the derived class via callbacks instead.

    Now look for more callbacks that should exist.

    -------------------

    Same treatment for client.

    -------------------

    Now extend the packet factory as well, and include additional packet types. 

    This needs to be tested, and easy to do, as this is the common situation, extend the client/server
    packet types with your own that must be processed.

    What needs to be done to client and server classes so they can let derived classes handle custom packet types?

    -------------------

    Need to design in the concept of both secure and insecure connects at the same time.

    Eg. should be secure by default, but the server can be opened up into insecure mode.

    In this mode, packets that are normally encrypted are globally allowed to be received unencrypted.

    When the client connects insecure mode, all packets are sent insecure. No safety here.

    Server allows insecure connections, eg. direct to slot without challenge token.

    -------------------

    Also make the heartbeat only get sent if a packet hasn't been sent for heartbeat rate...

    Don't send them redundantly when other packets are being fired across. Same for client -> server.

    Make sure that received packets, even unknown ones per-the base class let the timeout reset on receive.

    -------------------
    
    Up next, yojimbo_encryption_mapping.h/cpp?

    I think so. Derived from client/server expiring constant time structure?

    Must be dynamically allocated, don't use the stupid allocator, move away from it.

    -------------------

    Bring back the "pm loc" counter.
