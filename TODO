DONE    

    Kicked build to resolve premake5 download issue with travis.

    Key documentation areas: outside -> in.

        0. yojimbo_config.h

        1. yojimbo_server.h

        2. yojimbo_client.h

        3. yojimbo_transport.h

        4. InitializeYojimbo/ShutdownYojimbo

        5. yojimbo_connection.h ---> channel, etc?
TODO

    Very basic channel and connection level documentation has been added, but a second pass is required.

    Lots more information needs to be added here.

    However, this feels somewhat frustrating documenting this, because channels and connections are effectively *internals*, transparent to the user inside a client or server, in most cases.

    But I think if somebody wants to actually understand the library, they are going to want to understand the implementation. This is open source after all.

    I think the key is to split the documentation into sections:

    API, internals. I think I can section it up like this. Put the socket, connection, channel into the internal section.

    Some information on grouping here: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/grouping.html

    OK. That's enough for the day. Man this is slow, punishing work =p

    -----------------------------------------

        6. yojimbo_address.h

        7. packets, messages, allocators, message factory, packet factory.

        8. Front page overview linking to rest of docs?

    What other major bits need to be documented? Stream classes? Serialization macros? Helper macros for packet and message factories?

    My major concern at this point is that doxygen doesn't seem to allow documentation of macros? But, this would make it really hard to document all the serialize_* functions and how they should be used, and the helper macros.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
