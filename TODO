    5. Server needs "ConnectionContext m_clientConnectionContext[MaxClients]"

    6. Server needs "TransportContext m_clientTransportContext[MaxClients]" with per-client allocator, packet factory, message factory (if applicable), connection context (if applicable)

    Once this is working, the transition should be complex, and the context concept should be much simpler.

    ------------------

    Debug what is going on with the replay protection?

    Why is it slowing down connects?

    Does this still happen with the new per-client context replay protection?

    ------------------

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------
