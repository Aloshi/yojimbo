DONE    

TODO

    Now I need to work out where to pump the simulator for sends.

    One subtle point, if a packet is marked "immediate" (eg. disconnect packets), don't pump it through the simulator, just send it right away.

    

    ------------------

    Reduce remaining client/server tests with helper functions for pump update, client connect etc.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
