DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Extend client connect to take a list of servers to connect to.

    ------------------

    Reduce remaining client/server tests with helper functions for pump update, client connect etc.

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    ------------------

    Add a test to verify that server start/stop/start with a different number of clients works correctly.

    I just had a memory leak in this situation that went undetected because no test does this. This should always get picked up.

    ------------------

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------
