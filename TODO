Next steps? Are there some existing tests for the base connection that I could bring across?

It would be good to have a basic set of tests for acks etc.

Yep. Brought across a basic connection test. Passes.

There is another connection ack test, but this requires some callbacks in order to work. Should be reasonably easy to add.
