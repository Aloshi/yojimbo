TODO


















Plan of attack:

1. Port code to put the message in the send queue

2. Add the necessary data to the connection packet to includes messages in each packet

3. Port code to measure and determine how many messages can be put in the packet, fill the packet, fill structure mapping packet -> messages to ack.

4. Port code to receive messages

5. Test that messages are being sent reliably and in-order (bring across tests)

6. Extend the system to support large blocks

7. Bring across tests for large blocks

8. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks

9. Integrate with client/server

10. Implement some tests for messages inside client/server
