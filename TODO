        Helper macros for packet factories, message factories, setting up allocations in client/server (if possible)

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    =========================================

    Implement matcher and extend it to work with redis in real world examples.

    eg. Be a functional matcher that will accept registration information from servers, and match clients to connect to servers.
