Bumped up soak test to have some higher packet loss (99%), and it gets this:

    client sent message 11563
    Assertion failed: (int64_t(difference) >= int64_t(7)), function serialize_int_relative_internal, file ./yojimbo_serialize.h, line 291.

Need to track this down. It should work flawlessly under worst possible network conditions. It must not break.






--------------

Add large block support:

1. Extend the system to support large blocks

2. Bring across tests for large blocks

3. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks
