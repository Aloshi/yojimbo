    ------------------

    Server wastes time trying to remove encryption mapping for a client who connected via insecure connect

    Server should know that a client is insecure, and not waste time trying to clean up encryption mapping for that client on disconnect.

    ------------------

    Should add a test to verify that a client can switch from secure connect, to insecure connect, back to secure connect.

    There is a lot of shuffling of state in how these connects are performed, so need to test that this actually works or it probably doesn't.

    ------------------

    Add some client counters, they are useful for debugging.

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
