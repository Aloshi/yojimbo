TODO

    Can tests be reduced further with smart helper functions? especially, functions to pump client/server updates.

    This would shrink the largest tests, that are basically just copypaste pumps for clients, servers and transports.

    Another way to reduce the amount of test code would be to unify the tests so they all work from the same matcher and client/server implementation
    inside shared.h, this way the bulk of the definitions for messages, packets and so on, could be done only once. 

    This would shrink test.cpp considerably.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
