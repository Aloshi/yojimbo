DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Add a test case for both unordered and ordered messages to show that it properly handles a message failing to serialize, 

    ------------------

    Extend client connect to take a list of servers to connect to.

    ------------------

    Add some client counters, they are useful for debugging.

    ------------------

    Add a unit test that intentionally exhausts the client allocator on the server.

    Make sure the server detects this and disconnects that client.

    Make sure client can reconnect to the slot that was exhausted (eg. it is properly cleared).

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------
