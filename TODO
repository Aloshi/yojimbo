Next steps. 

a) Harden client connect so if any packet comes in that is a heartbeat packet, connection packet or any game type packet, and the client is still in a pending connection state, the connection switches to connected before processing that packet.

b) Add functions for creating, sending, receiving, addref and releasing messages to client and server.

c) Implement a client/server centric unit test for sending and receiving messages.

d) Implement a client/server centric soak test for sending and receiving messages (base on client_server.cpp)

e) Extend matcher and stress to continually be sending and receiving random test messages between the client and server.





Finish message system:

1. Integrate messages with client/server

2. Add some unit tests for client/server based messages.

3. Create soak test with messages exchanged between client and server.

4. Back port a minimal example (soak test) showing how to implement reliable ordered messages as example source code ("Building a Game Network Protocol")




Add large block support:

1. Extend the system to support large blocks

2. Bring across tests for large blocks

3. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks
