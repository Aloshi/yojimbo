DONE    

    Document smaller classes:

        Address


TODO
    
        Message

        BlockMessage

        MessageFactory

        Packet

        PacketFactory

        Allocator

        Utility functions

        Packet classes for client/server

        Token support classes and functions

        Encryption manager

    What other major bits need to be documented? Stream classes? Serialization macros? Helper macros for packet and message factories?

    My major concern at this point is that doxygen doesn't seem to allow documentation of macros? But, this would make it really hard to document all the serialize_* functions and how they should be used, and the helper macros.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.
