DONE

    Server now accepts an allocator and message factory in constructor. 

    If server has a valid message factory, connection objects are create per-client in Server::Start and cleaned up in Server::Stop (and in dtor now)

    This makes connection allocation and setup of message factory as optional, which I think makes sense. You may not want to use messages in your client/server protocol. Connection is also quite large, it allocates to big beast, especially if you have 64 players. Users of libyojimbo need a way to avoid taking this overhead, if they don't want it.

TODO

    Now integrate connection with the client.




Finish message system:

1. Integrate messages with client/server

2. Add some unit tests for client/server based messages.

3. Create soak test with messages exchanged between client and server.

4. Back port a minimal example (soak test) showing how to implement reliable ordered messages as example source code ("Building a Game Network Protocol")



Add large block support:

1. Extend the system to support large blocks

2. Bring across tests for large blocks

3. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks
