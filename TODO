    ---------------

    Now unit test all basic cases of the client/server, 

    client connect, 

    client reconnect, 

    timeouts while in each connecting state, 

    timeouts on client and server side after connection established

    client can't connect because full

    client-side disconnect

    server-side disconnect

    Should probably implement a local interface for these tests, so no actual packets have to go over the network.

    ---------------

    Next put in tests for cases that need to be handled and tested via counters, eg. invalid connect token discarded.

    Verify that packets sent over the network once client/server are connected have valid sequence #s and these sequence #s 
    are not always zero (make sure proper sequence #s are used)

    Make sure that encrypted packet packets can't get through if they are sent unencrypted. V.important obviously.

    ---------------

    Extend the packet factory so additional packet types above the client/server packet set can be sent and received.

    This needs to be tested, and easy to do, as this is the common situation, extend the client/server
    packet types with your own that must be processed.

    What needs to be done to client and server classes so they can let derived classes handle custom packet types?

    -------------------

    Design in the concept of both secure and insecure connects at the same time.

    Eg. should be secure by default, but the server can be opened up into insecure mode.

    In this mode, packets that are normally encrypted are globally allowed to be received unencrypted.

    When the client connects insecure mode, all packets are sent insecure. No safety here.

    Server allows insecure connections, eg. direct to slot without challenge token.

    -------------------

    Also make the heartbeat only get sent if a packet hasn't been sent for heartbeat rate...

    Don't send them redundantly when other packets are being fired across. Same for client -> server.

    Make sure that received packets, even unknown ones per-the base class let the timeout reset on receive.

    -------------------

    Need to implement packet aggregation and fragmentation and reassembly as well inside the socket interface,
    but by composition using base classes so this functionality can easily be reimplemented for other interfaces,
    eg. a network interface implementation that goes over boost asio instead of BSD sockets for example.

    -------------------

    Server should be able to dynamically configure how many clients it wants to support. There is a hard-limit max of 64,
    but it should be able to be configured dynamically to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or whatever.

    This is important because certain data structures, especially the stuff for reliability of messages, chunks and so on,
    will have a memory cost on the server according to the maximum # of clients allocated.

    So users of the library won't want to be always taking a cost proportional to 64, in say, a 4 player game.

    -------------------

    Possibly implement open/close support for the server.

    Implement a disconnect all clients function.

    If closed while players are connected, disconnect all clients.

    Perhaps open could accept max # of clients?

    -------------------

    Bring across the reliable ordered event system and large block sender.

    Store this reliability level system inside the client/server, have one of these endpoints per-client slot.
