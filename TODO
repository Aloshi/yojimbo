TODO

    Implement packet loss, latency, jitter estimates in reliable.io

    Integrate QoS settings above with yojimbo client/server and connection

    Test these between a real client and server running on my linode

    ------------

    Add ability to back-channel connect client and server (at the base client level).

    This should allow the ability to pump in client -> server packets for a connected slot, and server -> client packets.

    This will enable local loopback packet exchange between a client and server, and should work to a standard interface that is the same across all client/server implementations.

    This should be implemented as a netcode.io feature, and ideally integrated such that portions are in base client/server and can be reused easily across client/server impls.

    ------------

    Pass over doxygen documentation again.

    ------------

    *** Feature complete for 0.7 release ***
