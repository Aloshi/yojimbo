DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Probably time to make a new preview release now.

    But before this need to retest completely on windows, because I've made significant changes.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------
