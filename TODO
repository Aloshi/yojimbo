TODO

Now port the code that receives messages and puts them in the receive queue. Done.

Next step is to get the code for processing acks working, eg. ack messages that are in packet entries that were sent.

OK. Should be working now.

Are there tests I can bring across now?








Plan of attack:

1. Port code to put the message in the send queue (done)

2. Add the necessary data to the connection packet to includes messages in each packet (done)

3. Port code to measure and determine how many messages can be put in the packet, fill the packet, fill structure mapping packet -> messages to ack. (done)

4. Port code to receive messages (done)

5. Setup context

6. Test that messages are being sent reliably and in-order (bring across tests)

7. Extend the system to support large blocks

8. Bring across tests for large blocks

9. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks

10. Integrate with client/server

11. Implement some tests for messages inside client/server
