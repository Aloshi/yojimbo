DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Implement "replay" protection.

    Create a sliding window of last 1024 packets per-encryption mapping.

    If any packet comes in in the last 1024, check if it has already been received, if so, ignore it (don't decrypt). 

    If any packet comes in with sequence # older than the sliding window, discard it.

    Otherwise, process the packet normally.

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
