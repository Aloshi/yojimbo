TODO

So now need to extract out the core ack protocol into a system.

OK so the code to bring across is the "Connection" class. But I want to strip out the channel stuff from that, because I want to do things differently this time. I think.

I think I want to split out the ack system from "Connection" as "AckSystem". This will make it more reusable.

Nah, it's just so simple. There is nothing to split out!

Cleaned up the connection and it seems to be working fine.

Now to clean up the connection config. Remove the allocator and packet factory from there.
