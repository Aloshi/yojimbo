DONE

    Pass across all remaining allocations and convert them to use the allocator.

    Converted queue over to use allocator.

    Any other news or deletes? 

    Yes. There are a bunch of news and deletes. Mostly in test programs, but be consistent now and convert everything to use the allocator.

    Switching to the allocator is important because it provides memory leak detection. You don't want to be leaking memory.

TODO

    Convert remaining new/deletes over to allocator.

    Convert malloc inside windows network address iteration over to alloca

    Implement signal break for test, so it can be broken out of when tests are soaking

    Test under windows, mac and linux.

    Should be no memory leaks!!!
