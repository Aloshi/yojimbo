Back port to "Building a Game Network Protocol"

    1. Back port a minimal example (soak test) showing how to implement reliable ordered messages as example source code ("Building a Game Network Protocol")

    2. Clean up the source code in "Building a Game Network Protocol" as much as possible so that it isn't like a prototypical version of libyojimbo (which the client/server stuff kindof is...). Ideally, each example should only depend on protocol2.h and network2.h. Keep it clean.

    3. Where is the line between libyojimbo and "Building a Game Network Protocol". I think it has to become libyojimbo at the point when everything comes together in the secure server with encryption. Otherwise, it's just so much a reimplementation of libyojimbo in a single cpp file. Silly.

    More thought required on this one.





Add large block support:

1. Extend the system to support large blocks

2. Bring across tests for large blocks

3. Bring across soak test for messages and large blocks
