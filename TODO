DONE

    Integrate packet loss, latency from reliable.io

    Client and server need some way to get statistics to return to client, eg. num packets sent, num packets received, packet loss %, rtt milliseconds.

    Test these between a real client and server running on my linode, eg. print out network stats on client every few seconds.

    Having some trouble testing connection to linode server. Firewall issues?

    Resolved. Was rejecting packets incoming to lo0, not originating from localhost. Binding to server IP fixed it.

    Simplified RTT calculation and added more smoothing.

TODO

    Integrate netcode.io loopback client support and add loopback.cpp example showing usage, plus a unit test for it as well.
