DONE    

TODO

    Next step is to make the regular transport pump packet receive from the simulator.

    After this, enable simulated network conditions in client_server.cpp

    To make sure this always works, extend the travis job to run client_server.cpp.

    ------------------

    Reduce remaining client/server tests with helper functions for pump update, client connect etc.

    Look through remaining todos

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    ------------------

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
