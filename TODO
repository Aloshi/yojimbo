DONE    

    Message related functions in client.

    Message related functions in server.

TODO

    =========================================

    Almost done...

        Serialization macros (if possible)

            It *is* possible! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4542626/documenting-macro-functions-in-c-with-doxygen

        Helper macros for packet factories, message factories, setting up allocations in client/server (if possible)

    =========================================

    Proof read generated documentation. Expand on it. Fix typos. Add more references, etc.

    Make a new release "0.4 - Documentation". It's been a while since the last release. It's time!

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    =========================================

    Implement matcher and extend it to work with redis in real world examples.

    eg. Be a functional matcher that will accept registration information from servers, and match clients to connect to servers.

    =========================================
