DONE

    Seems that adding replay protection is stopping some valid packets getting through.

    I'm not sure why this is. There should be very few duplicate packets or out of order packets sent over loopback.

    The effect is severe, with 64 clients connecting, they all end up disconnected. Why?

    Idea: Move the replay protection into the context. This way there only needs to be MaxClients worth of them vs. MaxEncryptionMappings (there is much more of these...), also it should be easier to debug what is going on.

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
