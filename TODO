DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Extend client connect to take a list of servers to connect to.

    ------------------

    Add some client counters, they are useful for debugging.

    ------------------

    Client doesn't know their client id. It should probably be passed in to client connect.

    ------------------

    Run a profile session in Windows to make sure no performance issues have crept in.

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------
