DONE

    Split up network into multiple headers.

    yojimbo_network.h is good for address and sockets. Great. Leave that.

    Move the network simulator out to yojimbo_network_simulator.h

    Remove InitCrypto, instead put it inside InitializeYojimbo / ShutdownYojimbo instead.

    Move the token stuff into yojimbo_client_server.h

    Unit test the token stuff (based on 008 starter...)

    Remove the testing harness stuff from client_server.cpp

TODO

    Move the rest of the client/server stuff into yojimbo_client_server.h/cpp

    Eventually, going to want to make a bunch of this stuff more *configurable*

    eg. let the server restrict the number of clients he wants to allow to connect.

    even though the maximum of 64 is enforced statically at compile time...

    -------------------
    
    Up next, yojimbo_encryption_mapping.h/cpp?

    I think so. Derived from client/server expiring constant time structure?

    Must be dynamically allocated, don't use the stupid allocator, move away from it.

    -------------------

    Bring back the "pm loc" counter.
