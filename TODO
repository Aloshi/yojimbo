DONE    

    Reworked most context into "TransportContext" concept, underneath which is the connection context pointer and user context.

    Reworked all the transport code to operate from context specifically. If it can't find a context for the address, it uses the global context.

    This is a flexible setup. It doesn't require anything other than, data is specified per-address. Transport doesn't know about client/server, topology and so on, it just knows that certain addresses get special treatment. I like this setup. It's general.

TODO

    ...
    
    ------------------

    Run standard tests, make a new release.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
