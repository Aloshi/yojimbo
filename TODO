DONE    

    Kicked build to resolve premake5 download issue with travis.

    Key documentation areas: outside -> in.

        0. yojimbo_config.h

        1. yojimbo_server.h

        2. yojimbo_client.h

        3. yojimbo_transport.h

        4. InitializeYojimbo/ShutdownYojimbo

TODO

        5. yojimbo_connection.h ---> channel, etc?

        6. yojimbo_address.h

        7. packets, messages, allocators, message factory, packet factory.

        8. Front page overview linking to rest of docs?

    What other major bits need to be documented? Stream classes? Serialization macros? Helper macros for packet and message factories?

    My major concern at this point is that doxygen doesn't seem to allow documentation of macros? But, this would make it really hard to document all the serialize_* functions and how they should be used, and the helper macros.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.
