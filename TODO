DONE    

    Kicked build to resolve premake5 download issue with travis.

    Key documentation areas: outside -> in.

        0. yojimbo_config.h

        1. yojimbo_server.h

        2. yojimbo_client.h

        3. yojimbo_transport.h

        4. InitializeYojimbo/ShutdownYojimbo

        5. yojimbo_connection.h ---> channel, etc?

    Very basic channel and connection level documentation has been added, but a second pass is required.

    Connection doxygen finished first pass. Enough detail for now I think.

TODO

    Next, need to pass over channel and finish first pass documentation.

    After this, it's probably a good idea to hit the small classes like Address, Message, MessageFactory, Packet, PacketFactory, Allocator.

    What other major bits need to be documented? Stream classes? Serialization macros? Helper macros for packet and message factories?

    My major concern at this point is that doxygen doesn't seem to allow documentation of macros? But, this would make it really hard to document all the serialize_* functions and how they should be used, and the helper macros.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.
