DONE    

    Unified the TestMatcher and the LocalMacher. It's all in shared.h now.

    Moved LocalMatcher matcher to a static instance, so it doesn't have to be declared in each test that uses it.    

    Moved the GamePacket and packet factory into shared.h

TODO

    Next step, need to unify all the client/server functionality from the test.cpp game client/server instances to the shared.h game/server classes.

    Also need to solve for logging, need an option to completely disable logging in shared.h (can be #define), because I'm not going to want to see any logging while tests are running.

    Reduce remaining client/server tests with helper functions for pump update, client connect etc.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
