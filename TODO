TODO

    =========================================

    Helper macros to define packet factories.

    Helper macros to define message factories.

    =========================================

    Is there some automated spell check that I can run on code comments? That would save me a bunch of time.

    =========================================

    Proof read generated documentation. Expand on it. Add more references, etc.

    Make a new release "0.4 - Documentation". It's been a while since the last release. It's time!

    =========================================

    Where to host the generated documentation?

    How to build it automatically and upload it. Is this possible via travis? Wouldn't this create a security issue? (I can't exactly put KEYS in the source code...)

    How do other projects usually do this?

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    =========================================

    Implement matcher and extend it to work with redis in real world examples.

    eg. Be a functional matcher that will accept registration information from servers, and match clients to connect to servers.

    =========================================
