DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Reduce remaining client/server tests with helper functions for pump update, client connect etc.

    ------------------

    Rename "SimulatorTransport" to "LocalTransport" and move it into it's own file (or yojimbo_transport.*)

    Move the simulator hook up functionality into the transport by default, so all transport implementations can turn it on.

    Add a function to set all the network conditions on the base transport.

    Clean up test code to use the "LocalTransport" instead of deriving its own simulator / simulator transport.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Idea: don't allow fragmentation from client -> server, because it is a security risk?

    Alternatively, only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.   

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
