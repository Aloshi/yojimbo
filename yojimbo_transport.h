            However, during development you often want to simulate some latency and packet loss while the game is being played over the LAN,
            so people developing your game do so under conditions that you can expect to encounter when it's being played over the Internet.

            I recommend adding around 125ms of latency and somewhere between 2-5% packet loss, and +/- one frame of jitter @ 60HZ (eg. 20ms or so). 

            IMPORTANT: Take care when sitting simulated network conditions because they are implemented on packet send only, so you usually want to set HALF of the latency you want on client, and HALF of the latency on the server transport. So for 100ms of latency in total, you'd set 50ms latency on the client transport, and 50ms latency on the server transport, which adds up to of 100ms extra round trip delay.

            The network simulator allocated here can take up a significant amount of memory. If you want to save memory, you might want to disable the network simulator. You can do this in the constructor of your transport implementation. See NetworkTransport::NetworkTransport for details.

            @param duplicate The percentage of packets to be duplicated. Duplicate packets are scheduled to be sent at some random time up to 1 second in the future, to grossly approximate duplicate packets that occur from IP route changes.

            When a packet is received, the transport checks if that packetet type should be encrypted. If it should be, but the packet itself is not encrypted, the packet is discarded.
