        The set of state in the client state machine.

        A client starts in the default state CLIENT_STATE_DISCONNECTED (0). 

        Positive states lower than CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTED represent states where the client is negotiating connection to a server following a call to Client::Connect or Client::InsecureConnect. While in these states, Client::IsConnecting returns true.
        
        When a client state connects to a server it transitions to CLIENT_STATE_CONNECTED. While in this state, Client::IsConnected returns true and Client::IsConnecting returns false.

        Negative states correspond to client-side errors. There is one client state per error condition that the client can experience. If one of these errors occur, the client disconnects and transitions to that error state. When in one of these error state, Client::IsConnected returns false and Client::ConnectionFailed returns true.
