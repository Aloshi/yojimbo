    /**
        Provides protection against packets being sniffed and replayed.
        
        Basically a ring buffer that stores packets indexed by packet sequence number modulo replay buffer size.

        The logic is pretty much:

            1. If a packet is older than what can be stored in the buffer, ignore it. 

            2. If an entry in the reply buffer exists and matches the packet sequence, it's already been received, so ignore it.

            3. Otherwise, this is the first time the packet has been received, so let it in.

        The whole point is to avoid the possibility of an attacker capturing and replaying encrypted packets, in an attempt to break some internal protocol state, like packet level acks or reliable-messages.

        Without this protection, that would be reasonably easy to do. Just capture a packet and then keep replaying it. Eventually the packet or message sequence number would wrap around and you'd corrupt the connection state for that client.

            IMPORTANT: Global packets sent by the server (packets that don't correspond to any connected client) have the high bit of the sequence number set to 1. These packets should NOT have replay protection applied to them.

            This is not a problem in practice, as modification of the packet sequence number by an attacker would cause it to fail to decrypt (the sequence number is the nonce).
