=====================

    Convert protocol2.h

    Convert network2.h

    Split out parts of yojimbo_protocol.h / network.h to other files

    Especially, generally useful functions into yojimbo_util.h or yojimbo_common.h

    I like yojimbo_common.h better. Fuck util.

    Finish conversion of yojimbo_common.h inlines into yojimbo_common.cpp

    Move bitpacker into yojimbo_bitpack.h

    Move stream into yojimbo_stream.h

    Move serialization functions into yojimbo_serialize.h

    Now repurpose yojimbo_protocol.h into yojimbo_packet.h - packet header, packet class, packet factory, read/write packet functions.

    Split up network into multiple headers.

    yojimbo_network.h is good for address and sockets. Great. Leave that.

    Move the network simulator out to yojimbo_network_simulator.h

    Remove InitCrypto, instead put it inside InitializeYojimbo / ShutdownYojimbo instead.

    Move the token stuff into yojimbo_client_server.h

    Unit test the token stuff (based on 008 starter...)

    Remove the testing harness stuff from client_server.cpp

    Move the rest of the client/server stuff into yojimbo_client_server.h/cpp

    Eventually, going to want to make a bunch of this stuff more *configurable*

    eg. let the server restrict the number of clients he wants to allow to connect.

    even though the maximum of 64 is enforced statically at compile time...

    But for now, keep it static, and focus on implementing enough callbacks to extend the base class.

    eg. you extend the client/server to create your own versions, and demonstrate this by adding
    new packet types, implementing all client/server logs I want via callbacks (not the base class)
    etc.
